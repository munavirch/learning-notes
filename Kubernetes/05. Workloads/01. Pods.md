A pod is a basic execution unit in k8s. The smallest and simplest unit k8s object model. Pod is the smallest deployable object in k8s. A pod is an emphameral, disposable entities in k8s. Pod encapsulates an applications containers, storage resources, an IP address and configurations on how to run the containers. A pod can either have a single or multiple containers. Each pod is meant to run an instance of an application. Replication can be used to horizontally scale the application, thus k8s launches multiple pods and distribute the traffic among them.

Pods provides two kinds of shared resources to the container.

**Network**

Each Pod gets assigned a unique IP. Every container in the Pods shares the IP and network ports. Â Containers inside a Pod can communicate using `localhost`. Containers should coordinate how they use the network while communicating to external entities.

**Storage**

A Pod can specify a set of shared volumes. These volume are accessible by the containers inside a Pod. Shared storage provides a persistant storage in case some of the containers needs to be restarted.

Pods donot self heal themselfs. A Pod will not survive either the scheduled node failure or an eviction. Thus a Pod is not recommended to schedule as a standalone entity. Controllers like `Deployment`, `StatefulSet` and `DeamonSet` can manage pods enabling replication, roll out and self healing capabilities at a cluster level.

**Communication between Containers in same Pods**

Containers inside a Pod share the same IP and port space. Containers can find each other using `localhost`. Standard IPC (Inter Process Communication) techniques SystemV semisphere or POSIX shared memory can also be utilised for the same.

**Terminiation of Pods**

Since Pod represent a running process in a node, it is important to allow those processes to gracefuly terminate than forcefully killing and ensuring the Pod eventually deletes. When k8s receives a request to terminate a Pod, a `TERM` signal is sent to the Pod to allow the clean up. Once the grace period is over, a `KILL` signal will be sent to the process and then the Pod will be deleted from the apiserver. If kubelet or container manager is restarted while attempting to restart a Pod, the same will be tried again.

**Privillaged mode for Containers inside a Pod**

Any container who has the `privillaged` flag on security context set to true, the process inside a container will receive almost same privillage as the processes outside the container in case of linux capabilities like network device manipulation and device access etc.
