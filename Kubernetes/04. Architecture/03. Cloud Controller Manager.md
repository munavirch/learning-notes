CCM runs alongside with other master componenets. Previously, kubelets, kube-apiserver and other services are connfigured to connect with underlying cloud vendor. Introduction of CCM provides a single point of integration. CCM implemets the cloud dependent controllers of the KCM such as `NodeController`, `RouteController` and `ServiceController`.

**Function of CCM**

1.  Node Controller - Responsible for initializing the node by obtaining the information from the cloud provider. Obtained information include, cloud specific region and az, cloud specific instance details such as type and size, node's hostname and IP. In case of node failure, CCM checks with the cloud vendor before evicting the node.If the node is delete from the cloud, node obj is deleted from k8s.
2.  Route Controller - Only applicable for GCE for configuring appropriate routes so that containers in the clusters can communicate.
3.  Service Controller - Configures cloud LBs to reflect current state of k8s. Ensures service backends for cloud LBs are up to date.
