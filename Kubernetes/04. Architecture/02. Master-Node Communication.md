All **Cluster to Master** comminications are terminated at the apiserver. None of the master components are desinged to expose to the cluster except the apiserver. All nodes should be provisioned with a valid public root certificate such that they can connect securely using valid client credentials.Â 

Pods arer required to connect to apiserver using service tokens. Service toke and a valid client certificate are injected to the pod while bootstrapping.

There are two primary connection from **Master to Cluster**. First, apiserver to kubelet. Next, apiserver to any node, pod or service using kubeproxy.

Connectivity to kubelet are unsafe by default since apiserver doesn't validate kubelet's serving certificate. Use `--kubelet-certificate-flag` to enable the same. SSH tunnelling can also be used for this connection, which is not reccomended.
