*   Azure Policies is a service that can be used to define, assign and manage resource standards.
*   Prevents disallowed resource creation, checks policy compliance for newly created resources and can run a complaince report for existing resources.
*   Initiatives: group of related policies. Just like policies, initiatives can also be assigned to resources. Easy to manage multiple policies.
